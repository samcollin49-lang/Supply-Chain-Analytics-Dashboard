Supply Chain Analytics Dashboard

This project presents an applied supply chain analytics study using the DataCo Global Supply Chain dataset.
The work combines statistical analysis, academic inspiration from supply chain analytics literature, and an interactive Streamlit dashboard to generate business insights on delivery performance and profitability.

The project is supported by:

a Streamlit dashboard,

a written Overleaf report,

and a Beamer presentation.

Project Objective

The objective of this project is to apply Advanced Statistics concepts to a real-world supply chain dataset by:

defining meaningful KPIs,

analyzing delivery delays and profitability,

and presenting insights through interactive visualizations.

The methodology is inspired by academic research in supply chain analytics, particularly studies focusing on performance measurement and data-driven decision-making.
Rather than fully replicating a single research paper, the project adapts key analytical ideas from the literature to the DataCo dataset.

What We Did

Cleaned and prepared the DataCo dataset

Engineered key performance indicators:

Delivery delay

Late delivery rate

Profit per order

Performed exploratory and descriptive statistical analysis

Visualized:

Profitability by product category

Delivery delay distributions

Country-level late delivery performance

Developed an interactive Streamlit dashboard for data exploration

Linked findings to concepts discussed in supply chain analytics research literature

Research Inspiration

This project takes inspiration from supply chain analytics research, such as:

Carbonneau, R., Laframboise, K., & Vahidov, R. (2008).
Application of machine learning techniques for supply chain demand forecasting.
European Journal of Operational Research.

The academic literature guided:

the selection of performance metrics,

the focus on delivery reliability and profitability,

and the use of data analytics for managerial decision support.
